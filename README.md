Project Title: House Price Prediction Model using Linear Regression

Summary:
Developed a predictive model for estimating house prices using linear regression, aimed at providing valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals. Employed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building techniques to create an accurate prediction model.

Key Contributions:

Conducted data preprocessing by cleaning and handling missing values in the dataset.
Utilized EDA techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to understand the data distribution and identify significant variables impacting sale prices.
Selected relevant features and prepared the data for model building.
Implemented linear regression model using Python and libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn to predict house prices based on chosen independent variables.
Tested the model against test data to evaluate its accuracy and performance.
Achieved a prediction accuracy of 89% by considering a set of least correlated independent variables with the target variable.
Documented project methodology and findings for reference and future analysis.
